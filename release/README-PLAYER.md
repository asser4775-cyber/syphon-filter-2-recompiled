# Syphon Filter 2 Recompiled — owned-input player kit

This kit builds the complete two-disc **Syphon Filter 2 (USA)** campaign as a
native Windows x64 program using PSXRecomp, bootstrapped from SCUS-94451. It
contains no game executable, generated game/BIOS code, game assets, Sony BIOS,
saves, or overlay captures.

You must provide your legally obtained Disc 1 `.cue` plus its `.bin` track
files. The runtime uses PSXRecomp's bundled MIT-licensed OpenBIOS backend; a
Sony BIOS dump is not required.

The setup script extracts and hash-checks `SCUS_944.51`, regenerates the game
and OpenBIOS backends locally, builds the runtime and the real PSXRecomp
graphical launcher, and writes `play.bat`.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 x64, an internet connection, and approximately 6 GiB free.

That is all for the normal double-click path. `SETUP.bat` finds compatible
existing tools or downloads isolated, pinned, SHA-256-verified WinLibs and
Python archives directly into the kit. PSXRecomp, the launcher, and SDL are
also acquired as verified source archives. **WinGet, Git, pip, and Visual
Studio are not required.** Nothing is installed system-wide.
The large runtime compile uses at most four parallel jobs by default so it
remains reliable on lower-memory systems. Advanced users can pass
`-BuildJobs N` (1-64) to `SETUP.ps1` to change the limit.

## Easiest setup

Put the extracted kit, the Disc 1 `.cue`, and its `.bin` file(s) in the same
folder. Disc 2 can be there too: setup specifically selects the CUE whose name
contains `Disc 1`. Then double-click:

```text
SETUP.bat
```

The first build downloads pinned dependencies and can take several minutes.
Every archive is verified before extraction; extraction reports a heartbeat
every ten seconds and stops rather than waiting forever. When setup succeeds,
the PSXRecomp launcher opens automatically. Future runs only require
`play.bat`; the launcher lets you choose the disc, video, controller, keyboard,
and memory-card settings.

A complete `setup.log` is written beside `SETUP.bat`. Review it and redact
personal paths before attaching it to a public setup report.

## PowerShell setup

If automatic Disc 1 selection is ambiguous, open PowerShell in the extracted
kit and choose the CUE explicitly:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\SETUP.ps1 `
  -CuePath "D:\PS1\Syphon Filter 2 (USA) (Disc 1).cue"
```

The script recognizes `python` or the Windows `py` launcher and checks standard
installation locations as well as `PATH`. It similarly recognizes MSYS2,
older WinGet WinLibs layouts, and its kit-local verified toolchain. Downloads
are capped at 30 minutes; extraction stops with a useful error after 15
minutes. You can override the compiler with
`-Mingw "D:\Tools\mingw64"`, or use `-NoInstallDependencies` for a strictly
manual/offline preflight. Do not move individual files out of the extracted
kit. Memory cards are stored under `out\release\saves`.

## Dependency-only check

You can acquire and verify every public dependency before selecting a disc:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\SETUP.ps1 `
  -DependenciesOnly -InstallDependencies
```

This checks or installs the kit-local compiler and Python runtime, then
downloads and verifies the pinned PSXRecomp, launcher, and SDL source trees.
It does not read a disc or generate game code. A successful rerun reuses the
verified trees. A hash mismatch removes the downloaded archive before it can
be extracted.

If a download or extraction cannot finish, setup reports the owning dependency
and timeout in `setup.log`. Check free space and security-software quarantine,
then rerun the same command; completed verified dependencies are not repeated.

## Current state

- Both discs, the connected campaign, and the disc transition have been played
  and verified; public regression reports remain welcome.
- Mouse Look, Widescreen (16:9), and PGXP are independent launcher Mods. All
  three default off; enable only the enhancements you want before Launch.
- The Controls page supports two keyboard/mouse bindings per retail PAD
  control and applies saved edits to the same launch.
- Retail gameplay, scripts, AI, collision, camera ownership, saves, and the
  authentic 20 Hz world update remain game-owned.
- The resident executable is statically recompiled. Uncovered streamed
  overlays use the compatibility interpreter; native overlay promotion is
  deliberately disabled in this alpha and native coverage is incomplete.

True 60 FPS gameplay is not attainable through this project's pure
post-projection recompilation path. Three presentation experiments were
rejected for ghosting, unstable/cracked geometry, or sparse/incoherent replay.
A correct implementation requires at least partial matching decompilation—or
an equivalent semantic camera/object/bone snapshot and render-at-will
interface—like the architecture used by SF-PC-Port. High refresh is therefore
parked, not an active promise for this project.

## License and privacy

PSXRecomp is PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0; see `LICENSE-psxrecomp` and
`THIRD_PARTY_ATTRIBUTION.md`. This kit is for noncommercial research and
private play with legally obtained inputs.

Never redistribute the extracted `input/`, `generated/`, `psxrecomp-src/`,
`out/`, `play.bat`, memory cards, `overlay_captures.json`, or any package made
after running setup. Those local outputs may contain retail-derived code or
private paths.

## About this project

These ports are developed by a hobbyist (a DevSecOps engineer, not a game
programmer) with substantial AI assistance. What keeps that honest: every
change is validated before it ships - boot gates, hardware-oracle A/B
comparisons (Beetle/DuckStation), deterministic replay probes, and a shared
findings registry that documents failures as carefully as successes. AI
writes most of the code; the evidence discipline decides what survives.
Bug reports welcome - expect them to be investigated the same way.

tl;dr AI writes the code, but I always test it myself before pushing
