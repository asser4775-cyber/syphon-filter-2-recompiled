# v0.1.2-alpha

Setup-reliability update for the complete two-disc Syphon Filter 2 (USA)
campaign. Game behavior and the accepted optional Mods are unchanged from
`v0.1.1-alpha`; this release replaces the public dependency bootstrap.

This revision adds the shared PSXRecomp graphical launcher and a double-click
setup path. `SETUP.bat` auto-detects a neighboring Disc 1 CUE even when Disc 2
is also present, auto-detects PATH/MSYS2 MinGW toolchains, builds locally, and
opens the launcher. Later runs use `play.bat`.

The setup bootstrap uses no WinGet, Git, pip, or Visual Studio. Missing WinLibs
and Python runtimes plus the pinned PSXRecomp, launcher, and SDL sources are
downloaded directly into the kit, SHA-256 verified before extraction, and
bounded by explicit download and extraction timeouts.
Native runtime compilation now defaults to four parallel jobs, preventing
memory pressure from turning a first build into an opaque stage-6 failure.

Mouse Look, Widescreen (16:9), and PGXP are now independent Mods and all
default to disabled. The Controls page supports two bindings per retail PAD
control, Mouse1--Mouse5, and immediate same-launch persistence.

Included:

- statically recompiled resident executable;
- compatibility interpreter for uncovered streamed overlays;
- optional native 16:9 world presentation with authored 4:3 handling;
- optional PGXP geometry with atomic fallback when provenance is incomplete;
- optional direct mouse chase/aim camera with retail camera ownership;
- keyboard and controller input through the retail PAD path;
- 4x supersampling and OpenGL presentation;
- memory-card persistence;
- bundled MIT-licensed OpenBIOS.

Known limitations:

- broader public regression coverage across both discs is still wanted;
- high-refresh interpolation is not included; gameplay uses retail cadence;
- true 60 FPS is parked because the pure recomp boundary lacks semantic
  camera/object/bone state; it requires partial decompilation or an equivalent
  render-at-will interface;
- overlay execution coverage is incomplete and some areas may be slower;
- late-game HUD, FMV, fullscreen effects, and save/load transitions need more
  public playthrough coverage.

The downloadable artifact is an owned-input setup kit. It does not contain a
game executable: the player supplies SCUS-94451 Disc 1 as the build input and
their Disc 2 for the second half of the game, while the kit uses the
MIT-licensed OpenBIOS and extracts, verifies, recompiles, and builds locally.

Release qualification includes a clean-room setup from the packaged kit and a
rapid-start route with repeated movie skips, immediate briefing exit, player
ownership, and movement. Framework tests pass 54/54.
